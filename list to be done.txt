bugs to be fixed :

1- kill the captain , sometimes it ends and players are still in the map and cant get out , i suggest to fix it
or add a npc in the map to let you out

2- when your pk points are 30+ the TC conductress tells you ' i will not help murders ' and doesnt let you go to cities
or market , remove this function

3- need to check the steed race on test server ,the ending doesnt register properly and sometimes ure just there and dont win it

4- you can shackle alive players and if they die , they are shackled ,make this skill only work on dead characters O.o

5- you do not get the ying yang fruit upon winning the betting event ,only the cps

6- need to revise other players changing name and it adds to friendlist

7- some characters have skills they are not meant to have

  7.1   deathcandy is a pure water with tornado skill
  7.2   i have noticed i have reflect sometimes (i am water-monk-trojan) shouldnt have it

8- when you are sent to jail (dying when you are 100+ pk pts) you are sent to some coords where you cant see your character
 
  8.1 i think the coords are the next :   760.638

9- when youre flying as an archer , other archers cant hit you
@SuperNova
things to be modified : 

1- arrow packs are 500 ,make 10k again

2- remove the freeze effect from banshee it causes the sliding bug and it annoys eveyrone

3- reduce pots to heal 4k not 5k

4- Make the enemies give 3pk not 10

5- Make chain counter in custom (totally not important lol)

6- disable memory agate working on the new steed race map

7- archers normal attack is too fast ( needs to be reduced , they take pole too fast and in fights it stuns so much)

8- speedgun (spear skill) hits toooo much ,needs to be tested and reduced

7- make more spawns in vip maps,they SUCK SO BAD ,bird and bandit spawns are better

8- make online points per minute ,not hour, because if you are online 10 mins and you relog,you lose the 10 mins online
they should be 1 min = 1 point 

  8.1 we need to think of better rewards to keep players online and make server look active
things to be added :


1- met scroll to shopping mall ( npcs asks for 61 mets and its cancer to pack so many mets )

2- add [system] messages in screen (in the mid part of screen)  , can be the following :
2.1

      a- Selling/trading cps outside the game will lead to your accounts banned forever.
      b- Join our discord group to be in touch with the community and suggest/report stuff
      c- Random events every x:20 [KillTheCaptain,KingofHill,Lastman]
      d- SnowBanshee spawns every x:50 BirdIsland [P6 Drops only]
      e- TeratoDragon can be spawned in FG 6 or TC altar using DragonPills
      f- Administrators have [GM/PM] in their name
      g- Refer our server and gain rewards! (contact GM/PM or Moderator)
3- Leveling maps, i guess you can grotto 3 ,increase the exp rate by like x30 or idk, we need
players to get 140 easier ,we need newbies to stay in the game (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
